            <h2>The Icehouse.</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>The ICEHOUSE (In Case of Emergency House) is a self-sufficient prefabricated home that can be easily transported to flee or withstand dangers such as fires, floods and pandemics. Seeing people abandon their homes in Australia due to bushfires was my motivation. A family should not have to leave their home behind to be destroyed or be forced to stay in their current location and risk their lives to defend it.</p>
        <p>My concept has taken inspiration from Tesla and their million-mile battery. The ICEHOUSE wants to be a million-mile home. Sverre Fehn said “the very act of building begins the process of destruction, that every intervention, no matter how careful, contributes to the landscape’s loss”, therefore I believe we should relocate our homes as we do so we do not contribute to the landscape’s loss.</p>
        <p>The ICEHOUSE has a main and a minor housing option for growing families. Each space is connected to the outdoors in lieu of a single living space, this is for disasters such as a pandemic. If an individual falls ill, they can isolate within a room in either the main or minor houses to avoid spreading the illness. </p>
        <p>The design is 5m wide and 18m long, which fits within the transportation requirements in Australia. Due to these restrictions, electronic shutters were introduced to act as eaves when opened and provide security when shut. The ICEHOUSE is made from chromed steel and wrapped with metal cladding, this was chosen so the home can disappear into the environment by reflecting its surroundings, alike camouflage. Chromed steel shows grit and can withstand fire embers and the damage that may be caused from transportation. For transportation, all glass sliding doors and shutters can be removed to reduce weight and are all the same size to avoid difficulty during reinstallation.</p>
